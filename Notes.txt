Output of pos tagger can be done in different formats but if we were to use it in a java application, it seems to be in only one format (e.g. This/DT is/VBZ a/DT sample/NN file/NN ./)

We know that if it is run independently, we can output it as a tsv (tab separated 2) format. Using this we can use linux commands like grep and sort to perform operations.
We can assume that we are working on the following format:

This		DT
a		DT
is		VBZ
sample		NN
file		NN

such that the tags are sorted. Since we are looking for maybe nouns, we can use grep to obtain all the nouns and write them to another file "Noun_tags.txt".

Extraction of features can then be done on these nouns.

$ java -cp stanford-postagger.jar edu.stanford.nlp.tagger.maxent.MaxentTagger -model left3words-wsj-0-18.tagger -textFile input.txt -outputFormat tsv -outputFile tags.txt

grep -w "NN" tags.txt > Noun_tags.txt
awk '{print $1}' Noun_tags.txt
